# Introduction

Refer to README.org for instructions on setup

This is the official repository for all integrations between Apigee and Okta.
Apigee's API management does not include any Identity Management services(BaaS or
Appservices contains some basic capabilities but it is not an IDP). 
Okta which delivers Identity management for users is used by many enterprises to secure 
their APIs.

Apigee and Okta can be integrated to deliver to enterprises a rich API management capability
along with Identity Management for the users of the APIs.
